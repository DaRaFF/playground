# Layered Architecture

Currently I'm in the process of better understanding different approaches of layered architectures.

### Non Uniform Layered architecture
[Example Code](./layered-architecture/non-uniform)

```bash
cd ./layered-architecture/non-uniform
npm install
# init db
node init-db.js
# run the example code
node index.js
```
